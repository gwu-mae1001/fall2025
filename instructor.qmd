      Dr. Kartik V. Bulusu is an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, Washington DC. 
      
      He curated a cross-disciplinary course titled, Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing with applications in cyber-physical systems and speech processing. 
      
      In addition, he developed courses for first year engineering students on the engineering applications of Raspberry Pi, Python programming and mobile App development inspired by social innovation potential during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      
      His research interests span the areas of human health and sustainable energy with a focus on mechanics of biological fluids, low-cost energy technologies and applications of wavelet transforms. His current research work on biofluid dynamics of the cardiovasculature, rheology of biological fluids and applications of wavelet transforms has been supported by NSF and the Center for Biomimetics and Bioinspired Engineering (CBBE), GWU.  
      
      He developed a wavelet transform-based computational code (PIVlet) for the analysis of complex vortical patterns encountered in arterial blood flow. He has extensive knowledge of experimental fluid mechanics and non-invasive measurement techniques such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), schlieren imagery, magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) and molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV). Dr. Bulusu was recognized with the ASME Best Paper Award by the Advanced Energy Systems Division (AESD) Heat Pump Technical Committee, William and Louise Corcoron Award for contributing to the intellectual and social life and the Bender award for teaching excellence in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, GWU.

  <tr>
    <td width="60%">
I am ​Preethi Siva Kumar, graduate student in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. My research focuses on computational fluid dynamics, and I am currently working with Dr. Kartik Bulusu in the Biofluid Dynamics Lab. My work explores cardiovascular flow and the physiological effects of blood rheology.

​Before beginning my graduate studies, I earned my undergraduate degree in Aeronautical Engineering and gained practical experience in aerodynamics and controls by competing in competitions like SAE Aero Design and AIAA Design/Build/Fly. I am experienced as a software developer where I worked with JavaScript and Python.

​When I am not in the lab, I enjoy visiting museums and working hard to keep myhouseplants alive. I am looking for name suggestions for my new cactus, so feel free to share your ideas at my email below!

<!-- ## Swastika Bera (Graduate Teaching Assistant)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="60%">
Swastika Bera is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, specializing in fluid mechanics and soft matter systems. Her research investigates the deformation, breakup, and particle tracking of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), xanthan gum, and marine snow aggregates under laminar and turbulent flows. By combining experimental fluid dynamics, rheology, and advanced imaging, she explores how turbulence controls particle aggregation and carbon transport between the surface and mesopelagic ocean layers.

Prior to her doctoral studies, she completed her M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at South Dakota State University, where she developed corn kernel–based biocomposite films for sustainable food packaging applications. This work advanced environmentally friendly alternatives to petroleum-based plastics through the integration of natural fibers and biopolymers.

Beyond research, Swastika has presented her work at the American Physical Society and the AGU Ocean Sciences meeting. She is passionate about bridging fundamental fluid mechanics with environmentally friendly polymer applications that address global sustainability challenges. Outside of academics, she enjoys cooking, exploring new places, and reading comics.

    <td width="60%">
Salman Niazi is a senior studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University. He currently works as an undergraduate research assistant in the Micropropulsion and Nanotechnology Laboratory, where his focus is on air-breathing plasma thrusters and advanced propulsion systems. Salman has also gained industry experience through internships in the energy industry, where he worked on HVAC design and energy systems. Salman has previously been an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for the past two years and has loved every moment of it. He enjoys supporting students in and out of the classroom, fostering collaboration, and helping them gain confidence in tackling challenging concepts. Outside of class, Salman loves biking, exploring new cafes, and discussing emerging technologies.

## Olivia Falciani (Learning Assistant)

  <tr>
    <td width="60%">
I am Olivia Falciani, a senior studying mechanical engineering with a concentration in aerospace. I transferred from CCAS to SEAS at the beginning of my sophomore year. For over a year I have conducted research in the Thermo Fluids laboratory under Dr. Bardet. I have been working on the development of a solid polymer with a refractive index matched to water, which would be extremely beneficial to fluid dynamics research. For one year, I was a member of the rocket propulsion team. I am currently a member of Tau Beta Pi and president of Pi Tau Sigma at GW. I am very interested in materials science, thermodynamics, and heat transfer. I hope my experience at GW can help and encourage new mechanical engineering students, and I look forward to aiding this class.

## Shota Kakiuchi (Learning Assistant)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="60%">
I am Shota Kakiuchi, a Senior Mechanical Engineering student at The George Washington University with a concentration in Robotics. Currently, I am an Undergraduate Research Fellow under Professor Bulusu, where I study fluid mechanics and Internet of Things applications and explore how technology and engineering intersect.

I recently completed my internship at Deloitte in Cybersecurity Consulting and will be joining them full time after graduation. Alongside that, I’ve also gained industry experience as a Manufacturing Engineer Intern at Medtronic, giving me the chance to see how engineering connects to both technology and business.

Thanks to my international background, bilingual skills, and experiences across both business and technology, I’ve been able to make the most of my time in Washington, D.C., a city at the center of international, public, and government relations. If I weren’t an engineer, I’d probably be pursuing international relations or another path that lets me keep building bridges between people and ideas.

## Nathan Jannsen (Learning Assistant)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="60%">
I am a mechanical engineering student with a concentration in robotics, passionate about expanding my expertise in electronics, programming, and underwater applications. Over the past four years, I have gained hands-on experience through internships, research, and team leadership roles. 

As a NUWC Newport intern, I worked with technical documents and redesign projects, and as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Rau’s lab, I collaborated on a government-funded undersea mechanism. I currently serve as the Structures Lead for the Design-Build-Fly (DBF) team and previously acted as “Team Lead” for a large-scale Team-of-Teams project. 

My skills span design, rapid prototyping, electronics, fluid mechanics, and technical communication, reinforced by coursework in IoT for Engineering, Mechanical System Design, Electronics, Engineering Drawing, and Fluids. Outside of academics, I enjoy DBF, 3D modeling, going to the gym, and exploring new foods. I am eager to continue applying my skills while deepening my technical knowledge, particularly in the intersection of robotics and ocean engineering.
