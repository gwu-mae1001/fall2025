    <td width="70%">
      
      Dr. Kartik V. Bulusu is an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, Washington DC. 
      
      He designed taught a cross-disciplinary course titled, Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing with applications in cyber-physical systems and speech processing. 
      
      In addition, he developed courses for first year engineering students on the engineering applications of Raspberry Pi, Python programming and mobile App development inspired by social innovation potential during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      
      His research interests span the areas of human health and sustainable energy with focus on mechanics of biological fluids, low-cost energy technologies and applications of wavelet transforms. His current research work on biofluid dynamics of the cardiovasculature, rheology of biological fluids and applications of wavelet transforms has been supported by NSF and the Center for Biomimetics and Bioinspired Engineering (CBBE), GWU.  
      
      He developed a wavelet transform-based computational code (PIVlet) for the analysis of complex vortical patterns encountered in arterial blood flow. He has extensive knowledge of experimental fluid mechanics and non-invasive measurement techniques such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), schlieren imagery, magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) and molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV). Dr. Bulusu was recognized with the ASME Best Paper Award by the Advanced Energy Systems Division (AESD) Heat Pump Technical Committee and William and Louise Corcoron Award for contributing to the intellectual and social life of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, GWU.

  <tr>
    <td width="70%">
      **Rutvik**, was a grad student from Computer Science. Rutvik began his academic journey in India, completing his undergraduate studies at the Symbiosis Institute of Technology, where he cultivated a strong interest in technology. Before starting his graduate studies at GWU, Rutvik gained valuable experience as both a Data Scientist intern and a DevOps intern at a dynamic startup. These experiences sharpened his skills and fueled his curiosity about the ever-changing tech landscape. In addition to his studies, Rutvik was a teaching assistant in Prof. Bulusu's introductory courses on Python programming language.
