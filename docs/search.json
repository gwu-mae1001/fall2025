There is an alternative perception of IoT, as a design methodology that facilitates interoperability and connectivity of physical systems. Edge computing is a strategy for localized analysis of data, ahead in the pipeline of powerful data center- or cloud-based post-processing.\n\n\n \n\nIoT by Alla Zaleuska from Noun Project\n\n\n\n This workshop provides an introductory-level exposure of the IoT framework and expands it with edge computing ideology via practical and hands-on exposure. The attendees will be exposed to the IoT framework using sensors, IoT automation and connectivity in a “microLab” environment that includes the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language.\nThe attendees will be expected to bring their own laptops with the following requirements: \n\nPersonal machines or laptops (only) with:\n\nMac OS 12+ or Windows 10+ operating system\nOne USB A or USB C port that is available for use during the workshop\nWiFi connectivity\nA free version of RealVNC® Viewer software downloaded and installed (See instructions for details).\nChrome web browser downloaded and installed\n\n\nThe attendees will be expected to work \n\nin small groups using a limited number of hardware components and WiFi connectivity that will be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime & Location of the Workshop\n\n\n\nThomas Jefferson Meeting Room 1\n\nThomas Jefferson Library\n7415 Arlington Boulevard\nFalls Church, VA 22042\n\nMeeting time\n\n9:00 AM – 12:00 Noon",
