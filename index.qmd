The Internet of Things (IoT) is perceived as a collection of smart, connected devices with the ability to send and receive data; “internet” encapsulates connectivity and “things” are devices (electronic or mechanical) that can be adapted toward connectivity. There is an alternative perception of IoT, as a design methodology that facilitates interoperability and connectivity of physical systems. Edge computing is a strategy for localized analysis of data, ahead in the pipeline of powerful data center- or cloud-based post-processing.

This workshop provides an introductory-level exposure of the IoT framework and expands it with edge computing ideology via practical and hands-on exposure. The attendees will be exposed to the IoT framework using sensors, IoT automation and connectivity in a “microLab” environment that includes the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language. 

<strong>The attendees will be expected to bring their own laptops with the following requirements: </strong>

- Personal machines or laptops (only) with: 
    - Mac OS 12+ or Windows 10+ operating system
    - One USB A or USB C port that is available for use during the workshop
    - WiFi connectivity
    - A free version of RealVNC&reg; Viewer software downloaded and installed (See [instructions](install-editor.qmd) for details). 
    - Chrome web browser downloaded and installed 

<strong>The attendees will be expected to work </strong>

- in small groups using a limited number of hardware components and WiFi connectivity that will be provided.

## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
