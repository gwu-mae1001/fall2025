Welcome to the world of mechanical engineering—a field where imagination meets practical problem-solving to improve the way people live and interact with technology. 

The course is designed to inspire curiosity and develop critical thinking, giving you opportunities to apply mathematics and science to create solutions that matter. 

Whether your interests lie in building renewable energy systems, designing new mechanical devices, or simply understanding how things work, this course will help you build a solid foundation for your future studies and career in engineering. 

By the end of the semester, you will appreciate both the exciting possibilities and the responsibilities that come with being a mechanical engineer

As first-year mechanical engineering students, you are about to embark on a dynamic journey that introduces the essentials of mechanics, materials, energy, and design. 

- Throughout this course, you will learn not only by studying foundational principles, but also by working in teams on hands-on projects that mirror real engineering challenges faced in industry and research. 

- You will be exposed to designing, 3D priting and assembling with sensors and automation in unique “microLab” environment that includes the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language. 

## General information
The course we will meet in-person for both lectures and laboratories each week. The course will follow university guidelines if a virtual meeting is required.

  - Most of our communication to you will be by Blackboard messaging and announcements.
  - Start by reading the [**About**](index.qmd) section. 
  - Review the [**Course policies**](guidelines.qmd) and get familiar with the [**Instruction Team**](instructor.qmd).
    <!-- - These are the current [**office hours**](about.qmd#office-hours) being made available.  -->
  - They will be updated as the semester progresses.

## Student's main method of communication during the semester**
Our main method of communication is Ed, an online discussion board for questions and answers related to the course, whether technical or logistical in nature.

  - [**Join Ed here**](https://edstem.org/us/join/YxYM2t)
  - Do not post your source code to Ed. 
  - Think through your questions. Post a general concept of the programming concept. 
  - Your questions on Ed will be addressed within 24 hours.
  - **The students will be expected to work in:**
    - small groups using a limited number of hardware components and WiFi connectivity that will be provided.


## Course schedule 
The [**Schedule**](schedule.qmd) page outlines the weekly-schedule and what your deliverables are. It is YOUR job to keep to the schedule and submit work accordingly.
  
  - The first meeting of the course will be on **Friday** _(10/17/2025)_ [See [**Schedule**](schedule.qmd)]


## Laptop and personal compute machine requirements
The attendees will be expected to bring their own laptops with the following requirements: </strong>

  - Mac OS 12+ or Windows 10+ operating system
  - One USB A or USB C port that is available for use during the workshop
  - WiFi connectivity
  - See [instructions](install-editor.qmd) for much needed software installations. 
  - **We unfortuantely, cannot support for Chrome OS- or Linux OS-based laptops or iPads and other digital tablets.**
